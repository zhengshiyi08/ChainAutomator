# ChainAutomator

ChainAutomator is a Python-based project that combines blockchain technology and automation. It provides a framework and tools to automate tasks and interactions with blockchain networks, allowing users to streamline their operations and leverage the power of blockchain in their workflows. The project aims to simplify the integration of blockchain technology into various applications and processes.

## Features

- Blockchain interaction: Connect to and interact with blockchain networks using Python libraries like Web3.py or PyWeb3.
- Smart contract automation: Automate the deployment and execution of smart contracts on blockchain networks.
- Transaction monitoring: Monitor and track transactions on the blockchain, enabling real-time updates and notifications.
- Data management: Store and manage data on the blockchain using decentralized storage solutions like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/zhengshiyi08/ChainAutomator.git


2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Set up your environment:

- Configure the connection settings for the target blockchain network in the `config.py` file.
- Customize the automation tasks and smart contract interactions in the `automator.py` file.

## Usage

1. Customize the connection settings in the `config.py` file. Set the desired blockchain network, node URL, and other necessary parameters.

```python
# Blockchain network
NETWORK = 'ethereum'

# Node URL
NODE_URL = 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your-infura-api-key'

# Other settings
# ...
Customize the settings based on the blockchain network you want to interact with.

Customize the automation tasks and smart contract interactions in the automator.py file. Use the provided functions and methods to automate tasks like smart contract deployment, transaction execution, and data management.

from web3 import Web3
from config import NETWORK, NODE_URL

# Connect to the blockchain network
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(NODE_URL))

# Example task: Deploy a smart contract
def deploy_contract():
    # ... deployment logic goes here ...

# Example task: Execute a transaction
def execute_transaction():
    # ... transaction execution logic goes here ...

# Example task: Monitor transactions
def monitor_transactions():
    # ... transaction monitoring logic goes here ...

# Example task: Store data on the blockchain
def store_data_on_blockchain():
    # ... data storage logic goes here ...

# Run the automation tasks
deploy_contract()
execute_transaction()
monitor_transactions()
store_data_on_blockchain()
Customize the automation tasks based on your specific requirements and interactions with the blockchain network.

Run the automation script to execute the defined tasks:

python automator.py
The script will connect to the specified blockchain network, automate the defined tasks, and provide the desired functionality.
